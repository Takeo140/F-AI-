3. **03_functional.py**  
   Collection of functions.

4. **04_layers.py**  
   Definitions of layers and structures.

5. **05_logic.py**  
   Modules for logical computations.

6. **06_quantum.py**  
   Modules for quantum-related operations.

7. **07_demo_classical.py**  
   Classical demonstration script.

8. **08_demo_logic.py**  
   Logic demonstration script.

9. **09_demo_quantum.py**
